    <p><strong>MyWago</strong> is an auto-generated addon customized for you. All media files that you upload to WAGO plus any others that you star will be included in a format that WoW can read, and you can use them in your WeakAuras or any other addons.</p>
    <p>You have <%= mywagofiles %> included media files.</p>
    <p><a href="/mywago/download" class="btn btn-primary">Download</a></p>
    <p>Like any other addon, extract the MyWago zip contents into your &lt;WoW Install Directory&gt;/Interface/addons/</p>
    <p>Note that when adding new files to the game, you must restart World of Warcraft entirely. A quick reload UI won't be enough.</p>
