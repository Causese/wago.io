# Wago v3

Code is updated to version 3 of wago.io, currently found on the beta site https://t1000.wago.io (accessible to Patreon'ers).

# What's new?

There are a ton of changes behind the scenes but also more than a few cosmetic and usability upgrades in place at the user level:

1. On the go? Wago.io is now (mostly) mobile-friendly! The editor will be hidden by default on small devices so you can quickly review and respond to any comments.
1. The menus are more colorful and easier to distinguish each section and quickly find what you're looking for. The icons are provided by the wonderful people at http://game-icons.net/.
1. Search is now context sensitive. You can use keywords to search for users, tags or to enable certain options. Example search for `user: Ora` and you will see my profile. The built-in searches use these as well so dig around and find some more. I'll write up a detailed list soon.
1. Users now have avatars. Set yours on the account page! By default all users are given a randomly generated avatar from the lovely people at http://avatars.adorable.io/.
1. All dates and times are now local to your own timezone.
1. Screenshots and videos can be sorted.

Additionally, Wago is now setup up to support internationalization! If you're interested in volunteering to translate to your language then check out the [translation doc](translation.md) and find me on Discord.
