Several updates have been added over the last few days and I am now comfortable upgrading the site's status from Alpha to Beta.

1. ElvUI Import Strings
 * ElvUI profile strings are now supported on Wago and work much the same way that WeakAuras do. You can view the full table data and (if you know what you're doing) edit it by hand and save your changes to create a new string.
 * Also like imported WeakAuras, you can also include a description, screenshots and videos of your ElvUI setup.

2. Videos
 * Did I mention videos? Youtube and Twitch videos can now be added to all of your imports.

3. Search
 * Advanced Search can now find all the content with additional filters. Search specific types of content, search inside of custom code, find what you want. In the coming days I'll add some of these options to category and profile views as well.

4. Images
 * User [Crelam](https://wago.io/p/Crelam) has spent some time with [game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net/) and created over TWO THOUSAND custom media files that can be used in any WeakAura. Star your favorites to add them to your custom MyWago addon!
