No geocaching here. All Weakauras can now be included in Collections!

When logged in you'll see the new My Collections dropdown on any aura page, which allows you to create a new collection or add/remove the current WA to any of your existing collections. This can be used to organize groups of auras or to create a sort of package of auras for guilds they can share the link with. I'll be adding more options in the coming days but do let me know your feedback on Discord.

In other, probably boring news, I've refactored some of the code and re-organized the database. Things should be a bit speedier and it will help a great deal for the upcoming Advanced Search options.
