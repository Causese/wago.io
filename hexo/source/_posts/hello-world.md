This is the new DevLog for Wago.io. I'll keep this updated with new features as they get added.

Here are the main features that are currently available:

1. WeakAura Import Strings
 * Yup, those giant nonsense-looking strings can be imported from the game directly into Wago. You can then modify the data and generate a new string you can import back into the WA2 addon in-game!
 * The editor can pick out (most) custom functions and let you edit them directly with code editor. You can make and save changes to your WeakAura without changing the URL.
 * There is an Embed option to embed the string directly on your own website. This will automatically show the most recent version.
2. Media
 * Images can be uploaded and converted to/from .tga, .blp, .png or .jpg so that they can be used in-game.
3. Code Snippits
 * When importing a string you can instead import some lua code. The importer will automatically detect it and save your submission as a Lua code snippit.
4. Favorites
 * Star anything - Import strings, media, snippits and you can easily track them on your "My Starred" list under the user menu when logged in (top right).
5. MyWago Addon
 * All starred media, plus any media that you've uploaded yourself can be packaged and downloaded as a custom-built MyWago addon. Place this in your WoW addons directory like any other addon and all of the media will be available in-game. This works just like the Shared Media addon.
6. Comments
 * Yes you can post comments! To enable linkable URLs you must be verified as a human. Currently the only method of proving this to Wago is by logging in with a Battle.net account with a max level character.
